TheNews is a website and app that combines Hacker and Designer News. It's simple to quickly browse both, checking on the latest links, resources, and updates in the tech and web community. 

## Now for iOS
Under [thenews.im](thenews.im) by [Ahmet Sulek](twitter.com/ahmetsulek), [Tosin Afolabi](twitter.com/tosinaf), and I decided to bring it over to iOS. It takes advantage of native gestures, as well as conditioned gestures to make for a clean, natural feeling experience. I was lucky enough to have a target user base that is experienced with gestures. Swiping the navigation bar at the top switches between Designer and Hacker News. Swiping a post from right to left takes the user to the comment thread. Swiping from left to right "up votes" the post.

You can see the app landing page here: [TheNews App](http://thenewsapp.co/).
