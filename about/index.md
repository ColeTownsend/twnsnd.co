### _Insouciance_ — a relaxed and calm state.
I pride myself in my ability to stay calm, to stay in the moment. This applies to design, to running, to living. My name is Cole Townsend, and I am a designer.

I  also study Art History at Williams College. I like chemex coffee, running, and napping — in that order. I think programming is cool, but don't actually program that much. I'm always trying to learn new things, though. XCode and iOS development are on my shortlist.

I am currently {{site.data.work_status}} for work, but I always reply to emails. <a href='m&#97;&#105;lto&#58;&#99;%6Fl%65&#64;tw&#37;6Esn&#37;64%2Ec&#37;&#54;F'>Let's talk</a>.
